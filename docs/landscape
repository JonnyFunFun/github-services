Landscape is a continuous code quality inspector for Python projects.

By enabling this hook, Landscape will listen for pushes and on each push, instigate a new code check.

Install Notes
-------------

Currently, Landscape operates by polling GitHub for changes. This hook is an optional extra which will
speed up Landscape's reaction to pushes, but it is not necessary.

To install:

1.  Create an account at https://landscape.io (you can sign in with GitHub)
2.  Enable this hook - there are no additional details required.
    - If a repository has not been enabled for checking on Landscape, it will be enabled automatically once the first push is received
